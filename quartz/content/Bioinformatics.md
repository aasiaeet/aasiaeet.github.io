Bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, and statistics to analyze biological data.

## Key Areas

### Transcriptomics

Gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq:

$$\text{RPKM} = \frac{\text{reads mapped to gene} \times 10^9}{\text{total reads} \times \text{gene length}}$$

### Single-Cell Analysis

Challenge: dealing with **zero inflation** in scRNA-seq data.

## Applications

- **Cancer genomics** - understanding tumor heterogeneity
- **Drug discovery** - identifying therapeutic targets
- **Personalized medicine** - tailoring treatments

## Connections

- Uses [[Machine Learning]] for prediction and classification
- [[Causal Inference]] helps identify regulatory relationships
- [[High Dimensional Statistics]] addresses the $p \gg n$ problem
