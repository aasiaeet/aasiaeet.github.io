My research sits at the intersection of **statistical learning, causal inference, and computational biology**, with a particular focus on **building principled models that connect high-dimensional molecular data to interpretable biological and clinical questions**.

Rather than developing methods in isolation, my work is organized around **recurring scientific challenges** that arise across genomics, immunology, and clinical research: heterogeneity, confounding, limited experimental control, and the need to generalize across populations, conditions, and data modalities.

Below are the main themes that define my current research program.

## 1. Causal Inference in Complex Biological Systems

A central goal of my work is to move beyond associative modeling toward **causal explanations of biological mechanisms**. In modern biomedical data, causal questions are complicated by latent confounding, selection bias, and distributional mismatch between studies.

I develop **causal inference and causal discovery methods** that are designed to operate under these realistic constraints, with particular emphasis on:
- combining experimental and observational data,
- learning structured causal relationships in high dimensions,
- and quantifying uncertainty in causal conclusions.

These methods are motivated by applications in functional genomics, immunology, and clinical decision-making, where interventions are costly and causal assumptions must be made explicit and testable.

## 2. Data Fusion Across Experimental and Observational Studies

Randomized controlled trials provide strong internal validity but are often limited in scope, size, and representativeness. Observational studies are abundant but confounded. A recurring theme in my work is **how to integrate these complementary data sources in a principled way**.

My research develops frameworks for:
- borrowing information across studies with different covariates and populations,
- improving efficiency of causal effect estimation,
- and maintaining robustness when standard identifiability assumptions fail.

This line of work connects ideas from **transfer learning, domain adaptation, and semiparametric inference**, and is motivated by problems in clinical trials, regulatory science, and real-world evidence.

## 3. Multiscale Modeling of Immune and Regulatory Systems

Biological systems operate across multiple scales, from molecular interactions to cellular populations and tissues. My work aims to develop **models that explicitly connect these scales**, rather than treating them independently.

Recent efforts focus on:
- regulatory molecules and transcriptional control,
- immune cell interactions and signaling,
- and ecological perspectives on host–pathogen co-evolution.

A unifying idea in this work is that **persistent structure in biological systems can be revealed by studying constrained, reusable components**—whether regulatory programs, immune niches, or conserved interaction patterns.

## 4. Keystone Structures and Ecological Perspectives in Immunology

An emerging direction in my research explores **ecological and systems-level perspectives on immunity**, including the concept of *keystone components* that disproportionately shape immune responses.

This work investigates:
- how long-lived pathogens and conserved epitopes shape immune memory,
- how immune responses generalize or fail across contexts,
- and how these structures can explain both protection and adverse immune reactions.

The goal is to develop computational frameworks that link molecular specificity to system-level behavior, with implications for vaccine design, immune-mediated adverse events, and personalized risk assessment.

## 5. High-Dimensional Learning with Structure and Constraints

Many biomedical inference problems are high-dimensional, undersampled, and structured. A recurring methodological theme in my work is **leveraging structure to make learning possible and interpretable**.

This includes:
- structured regularization and multitask learning,
- learning under sparsity, low-rank, or hierarchical constraints,
- and designing estimators that remain stable across environments.

These ideas appear throughout my work, from transcriptomic modeling to causal discovery and data fusion.

## 6. Statistical Software and Reproducible Tools

Across all research themes, I place strong emphasis on **reproducibility and accessibility**. Many of my projects include the development of open-source software that implements new methods in a transparent and reusable way.

This includes:
- statistical packages for high-dimensional inference,
- tools for causal analysis and data integration,
- and pipelines designed to be extensible to new datasets and domains.

### Working with Me

I collaborate closely with researchers in **biostatistics, biomedical informatics, immunology, and clinical sciences**, and regularly mentor students, postdocs, and interns from diverse quantitative backgrounds.

If you are a student or trainee interested in:
- causal inference,
- computational biology,
- statistical learning for biomedical data,
- or systems-level modeling of immune and regulatory processes,

feel free to reach out. I am especially interested in collaborations that combine **theory, data, and real scientific questions**.
