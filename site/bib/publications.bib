              Motivation
              : Cancer is the process of accumulating genetic alterations that confer selective advantages to tumor cells. The order in which aberrations occur is not arbitrary, and inferring the order of events is challenging due to the lack of longitudinal samples from tumors. Moreover, a network model of oncogenesis should capture biological facts such as distinct progression trajectories of cancer subtypes and patterns of mutual exclusivity of alterations in the same pathways.
            
            In this paper, we present the disjunctive Bayesian network (DBN), a novel oncogenetic model with a phylogenetic interpretation. DBN is expressive enough to capture cancer subtypes' trajectories and mutually exclusive relations between alterations from unstratified data.
            
              Results
              : In cases where the number of studied alterations is small (), we provide an efficient dynamic programming implementation of an exact structure learning method that finds a best DBN in the superexponential search space of networks. In rare cases that the number of alterations is large, we provided an efficient genetic algorithm in our software package, OncoBN. Through numerous synthetic and real data experiments, we show OncoBN's ability in inferring ground truth networks and recovering biologically meaningful progression networks.

              Cancer progression, including the development of intratumor heterogeneity, is inherently a spatial process. Mathematical models of tumor evolution may be a useful starting point for understanding the patterns of heterogeneity that can emerge in the presence of spatial growth. A commonly studied spatial growth model assumes that tumor cells occupy sites on a lattice and replicate into neighboring sites. Our R package
              SITH
              provides a convenient interface for exploring this model. Our efficient simulation algorithm allows for users to generate 3D tumors with millions of cells in under a minute. For the distribution of mutations throughout the tumor,
              SITH
              provides interactive graphics and summary plots. Additionally,
              SITH
              can produce synthetic bulk and single‐cell DNA‐seq datasets by sampling from the simulated tumor. A streamlined application programming interface (API) makes
              SITH
              a useful tool for investigating the relationship between spatial growth and intratumor heterogeneity.
              SITH
              is a part of
              CRAN

  abstract = {We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc\{DECOR\}, a single likelihood-based and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from \$(\B,\OmegaMat)\$ to the observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with \$n{\textless}p\$, \textsc\{DECOR\} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under pervasiveness.},

  abstract = {Understanding how treatment effects vary across patient characteristics is essential for personalized medicine, yet randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often underpowered to detect heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). We propose a framework that improves the efficiency of conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation in RCTs by leveraging large observational studies (OS) while preserving the unbiasedness of RCT estimates. By framing CATE estimation as a supervised learning problem, we show that estimation variance is minimized using the counterfactual mean outcome (CMO) as an augmentation function. We derive finite-sample error bounds and establish conditions under which OS data improves CMO estimation, and thus CATE efficiency, even in the presence of confounding in the OS or outcome distribution shifts between populations. We introduce R-OSCAR (Robust Observational Studies for CMO-Augmented RCT), a two-stage estimator that calibrates OS outcome predictions to the RCT population and corrects residual biases through regularized regression. Simulations show that R-OSCAR can reduce the RCT sample size needed for HTE detection by up to 75\%, maintaining robustness to model misspecification. Application to the Tennessee STAR study confirms these efficiency gains. Our framework offers a principled approach to integrating observational and experimental data using tools from statistical learning and transfer learning.},

  title = {Revisiting non-progressive influence models: scalable influence maximization in social networks},
  abstract = {While influence maximization in social networks has been studied extensively in computer science community for the last decade the focus has been on the progressive influence models, such as independent cascade (IC) and Linear threshold (LT) models, which cannot capture the reversibility of choices. In this paper, we present the Heat Conduction (HC) model which is a non-progressive influence model with real-world interpretations. We show that HC unifies, generalizes, and extends the existing nonprogressive models, such as the Voter model [1] and non-progressive LT [2]. We then prove that selecting the optimal seed set of influential nodes is NP-hard for HC but by establishing the submodularity of influence spread, we can tackle the influence maximization problem with a scalable and provably near-optimal greedy algorithm. We are the first to present a scalable solution for influence maximization under non-progressive LT model, as a special case of the HC model. In sharp contrast to the other greedy influence maximization methods, our fast and efficient C2GREEDY algorithm benefits from two analytically computable steps: closed-form computation for finding the influence spread as well as the greedy seed selection. Through extensive experiments on several large real and synthetic networks, we show that C2GREEDY outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both influence spread and scalability.},

Synthetic data generation offers a promising privacy-preserving alternative, but producing realistic synthetic cohorts of PWH remains challenging due to complex temporal dynamics, interdependent clinical variables, long follow-up periods, and high missingness inherent in such data. Here, we introduce Medical Longitudinal latent Diffusion (MeLD), a generative model designed to synthesize variable-length, decades-spanning, mixed-type clinical trajectories with missingness. Using the Caribbean, Central, and South America Network for HIV Epidemiology (CCASAnet) cohort, one of the world's largest international HIV datasets with over 30 years of follow-up on nearly 50,000 PWH, we show that MeLD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across data utility, fidelity, and privacy. Notably, MeLD excels in longitudinal inference utility, accurately reproducing time-to-death estimates and risk factor effects, while maintaining strong privacy protection. This work delivers the first in-depth, large-scale, and openly accessible synthetic longitudinal cohort of PWH that faithfully preserves the distributional patterns and clinical associations observed in real data, offering an immediately deployable resource for hypothesis generation, methods innovation, medical training, and reproducible HIV research.},
