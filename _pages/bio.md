I am an Assistant Professor of [Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/) at the [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). Before joining Vanderbilt, I was a postdoctoral fellow  at the [Mathematical Biosciences Institute](https://mbi.osu.edu/) and the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medicine.osu.edu/bmi/Pages/index.aspx) at the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) working with Professor [Kevin Coombes](https://medicine.osu.edu/bmi/people/kevin_coombes/pages/index.aspx).  I am currently supported by an [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) [K99/R00](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-188.html) grant. 

My research interests are machine learning, computational biology, and bioinformatics. Currently, I am working on the causal effect estimation of regulatory molecules on transcription. I also have ongoing collaborations with oncologists and working on interesting cancer-related problems such as drug screening and cancer progression modeling.

I completed my PhD in [Computer Science](cs.umn.edu) at the [University of Minnesota](www.umn.edu) in 2017. At the UMN, I worked on high dimensional statistics and social network analysis under the supervision of Professor [Arindam Banerjee](www-users.cs.umn.edu/~banerjee/).  I obtained my master's degree (MSc) in Artificial Intelligence from [University of Tehran](http://ece.ut.ac.ir/en). I was also an undergrad at the University of Tehran in Software Engineering. I spent a summer at [Technicolor research](http://www.technicolorbayarea.com/) working on electro-dermal signal modeling with [Fernando Silveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandojorgesilveira/).

It was my honor to study at the [Alavi Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alavi_Institute) during my high school years where I was blessed with great teachers and friends. I was a competitive swimmer in middle and high school and became a member of Tehran's swimming and water polo teams. I was playing right wing in the [mushroom formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo#Common_techniques_and_practices). Later on, I became a member of University of Tehran's swimming team.
