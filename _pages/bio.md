I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Mathematical Biosciences Institute](https://mbi.osu.edu/) at the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) working with Professor [Kevin Coombes](https://medicine.osu.edu/bmi/people/kevin_coombes/pages/index.aspx). I completed my PhD in [computer science](cs.umn.edu) at [University of Minnesota](www.umn.edu) in 2017. 

My research interests are machine learning, computational biology, and bioinformatics. Currently, I am applying machine learning techniques to cancer data. At UMN, I worked on high dimensional statistics and social network analysis under the supervision of Professor [Arindam Banerjee](www-users.cs.umn.edu/~banerjee/). 

I obtained my master's degree (MSc) in Artificial Intelligence from [University of Tehran](http://ece.ut.ac.ir/en). I was also an undergrad at the University of Tehran in Software Engineering. I spent a summer at [Technicolor research](http://www.technicolorbayarea.com/) working on electro-dermal signal modeling with [Fernando Silveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandojorgesilveira/).

It was my honor to study at [Alavi Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alavi_Institute) during my high school years where I was blessed with great teachers and friends. 

I was a competitive swimmer in middle and high school and became a member of Tehran's swimming and water polo teams. I was playing right wing in the [mushroom formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo#Common_techniques_and_practices). Later on, I became a member of University of Tehran's swimming team.
