I am a postdoctoral fellow  at the [Mathematical Biosciences Institute](https://mbi.osu.edu/) and the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medicine.osu.edu/bmi/Pages/index.aspx) at the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) working with Professor [Kevin Coombes](https://medicine.osu.edu/bmi/people/kevin_coombes/pages/index.aspx). I completed my PhD in [computer science](cs.umn.edu) at the [University of Minnesota](www.umn.edu) in 2017. 

My research interests are machine learning, computational biology, and bioinformatics. Currently, I am applying machine learning techniques to cancer data. At the UMN, I worked on high dimensional statistics and social network analysis under the supervision of Professor [Arindam Banerjee](www-users.cs.umn.edu/~banerjee/).
