I am an Assistant Professor of [Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/) at the [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). Before joining Vanderbilt, I was a postdoctoral fellow  at the [Mathematical Biosciences Institute](https://mbi.osu.edu/) and the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medicine.osu.edu/bmi/Pages/index.aspx) at the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) working with Professor [Kevin Coombes](https://medicine.osu.edu/bmi/people/kevin_coombes/pages/index.aspx).  I am currently supported by an [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) [K99/R00](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-188.html) grant. 

My research interests are machine learning, computational biology, and bioinformatics. Currently, I am working on the causal effect estimation of regulatory molecules on transcription. I also have ongoing collaborations with oncologists and working on interesting cancer-related problems such as drug screening and cancer progression modeling.
